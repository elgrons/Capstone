### Research & Planning Log for Epicodus Capstone Project

#### Friday, 4.28

* 8:12: Create Figjam file for planning : https://www.figma.com/file/7ccXDVSTxf9EsU8eO2a3xP/Capstone-Planning?node-id=2%3A62&t=G9DfON0TAEaXD923-1

* 9:45: researching using React with ASP.NET Core. Compiled a list complete with videos and got a little overwhelmed at the general concept of incorporating C# and React. Will come back to this information to review. Coming to an understanding that I might need to set up a .NET API to fetch data from MySQL database and import data into React components. Will need to research this further and possibly read further into the lesson plan homework to see if this is something we'll cover in the coming weeks.

* 10:30 building out a react component diagram and schema diagram in figma to try to organize my project structure and see if it helps refine my needs for above research findings.

*  11:40 distracted away from building out my component becuase I think it's getting ahead of myself a little bit. File folder/project strucutre still needs some refining. Back to research and compiling a list of videos to watch after lunch. 

* 1:00p amassed a pretty solid amount of tutorial videos to help me streamline my overall project stucutre file build and components. will begin viewing and deciding what is/isn't helpful or able to contribute to my vision for my mvp/finished project.

* 1:45 take a break from tutorials to partially update capstone-proposal.md as the project starts to form a little bit more in my mind. pushing the partially complete project proposal and back to internet tutorials for research purposes.

* 2:23 update README with a screen shot from figam project file with "soft" component mock up for React front end, still diving into some research to see if it'll be usable, but slowly starting to put pieces together in my mind and on "paper". :) returning to tutorial-style research vidoes and reading.

* 4:00 WIP research and gathering inspo for styling, content, and layout: still working on research and updating figma.
