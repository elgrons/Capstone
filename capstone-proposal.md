Name of Project: TBA /  Tip Tracker

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
	
	This project is going to 


List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

  For my MVP I want to ensure that the user stories are:

* A user can register, sign in, and sign out
* A user can enter their tip data (including cash, credit cards, and possibly other things like total sales, hours worked, and tax percentage applied to tips)
* A user can see their tip data over different time periods

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP?

Frontend: 
  * React
  * Node
  * JX 
  * JavaScript
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Boostrap/Chakra, possibly a different styling library

Backend: 
  * C#
  * MySQL
  * Axios(?) 
  * Razor 
  * .NET 6
  * ASP.NET Core

I believe I’ll need to turn the data from MySQL database into an API so that the data is sent correctly to my React components and possibly use Axios based on my initial research.

* Some of these may change as the project progresses.



If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

	My stretch goals for this project are:
* A user can enter tip data in for multiple jobs (possible stretch goal)
* A user can enter in their work schedule (possible stretch goal)
* I’d like to have some sort of privacy/safety feature since the information isn’t stored locally (possible stretch goal)

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
	
	Additional tools that I might require are 

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

	I’d like the instructor to know that 

	I’ll be curious to see how I might adapt any project planning over the course of the next few weeks as I learn more about React.
