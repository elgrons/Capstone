Name of Project: Project Name TBA /  Tip Tracker

Project's Purpose or Goal:

  This project is going to allow a user who works in an industry that includes gratuity to track their daily income.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

  For my MVP I want to ensure that the user stories are:

* A user can register, sign in, and sign out
* A user can enter their tip data (including cash, credit cards, and possibly other things like total sales, hours worked, and tax percentage applied to tips)
* A user can see their tip data over different time periods
* If a user works multiple shifts and/or multiple jobs in the same day I'd like to be able to differentiate between shifts in ways other than just by calendar date. This might be easier or more difficult than I imagine pending on project set up.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP?

Frontend: 
  * React
  * Node
  * JX 
  * JavaScript
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Boostrap/Chakra, possibly a different styling library

Backend: 
  * C#
  * MySQL
  * Axios(?) 
  * Razor 
  * .NET 6
  * ASP.NET Core

I believe I’ll need to turn the data from MySQL database into an API so that the data is sent correctly to my React components and possibly use Axios based on my initial research.

* Some of these may change as the project progresses.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next?

  My stretch goals for this project are:
* A user can enter tip data in for multiple jobs
* A user can enter in their work schedule
* I’d like to have some sort of privacy/safety feature since the information isn’t stored locally
* Perhaps an API included that could be used as a currency exchanger or apply county/state taxes to income totals

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

  Additional tools that I might require are possibly an API for currency exchange, location services to enable local county/state taxes (or an API that already includes that info).

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

  I’ll be curious to see how I might adapt any project planning over the course of the next few weeks as I learn more about React. I'm eager to know more about utilizing hooks and Firebase to see if they might be helpful inclusions for this project idea.
